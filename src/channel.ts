/**
 * Channel creates a pumpable iterator. It's useful as a concurrent communication
 * medium.
 *
 * It enables you to use the iterable utility functions this library provides in cases
 * where you don't have an iterator, but you have maybe an event listener and every time
 * the event is triggered you want to push a new element into an async iterator chain.
 *
 * Another way to think about it is forward pressure. Async iterators inherently support
 * back pressure, meaning an async iterator calls next at it's pleasure and the upstream
 * source has to wait. In this case, the upstream source can fulfill the request for next
 * whenever it likes.
 *
 * A final way to think about this abstraction is that of streams. A readable string is
 * equivalent to an async iterator. It provides an api for reading from it as fast as you want
 * (and as fast as it'll go). What's the equivalent for a writable stream that writes
 * into a readable stream? That's where Channel is useful.
 *
 * The underlying data structure is a linked list with two iterators that can append new nodes
 * as they need to. For example, if writes outpace reads or reads outpace writes then new
 * nodes are created to make promises for future fulfillment using PairedPromises.
 *
 * TODO: Should write the base class that support two way.
